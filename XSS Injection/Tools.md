🚀 Introducing XSSDynaGen

🪄 XSSDynaGen is a tool designed to analyze URLs with parameters, identify the characters allowed by the server, and generate advanced XSS payloads based on the analysis results. It utilizes fast and modern technologies like AsyncIO and aiohttp for high-speed scanning and payload generation.

⚡ Asynchronous Processing: AsyncIO and aiohttp for high-performance concurrent scanning.
🔍 Parameter Character Analysis: Tests allowed and blocked characters for each parameter.
💣 Dynamic Payload Generation: Produces tailored XSS payloads based on server allowed characters.
🗂️ Customizable Character Sets: Load and define your own custom character groups for tailored payload generation.
🛡️ Advanced Evasion: Generates payloads with techniques like null bytes, Unicode encoding, and obfuscation.
📦 Batch Processing: Efficient handling of large URL lists with configurable batch sizes and connection limits.
📝 Organized Output: Saves generated payloads to structured files for easy use.
⚙️ Customizable: Adjustable timeout, concurrency, and output settings.
🔄 Auto-Updater: Check for and apply the latest updates seamlessly via Git integration.
