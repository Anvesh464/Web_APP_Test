### 1. **Understanding Web Cache Deception (WCD):**
   - **What is Web Cache Deception (WCD), and how does it differ from regular Web Cache Poisoning?**
   - **Can you explain the typical lifecycle of a Web Cache Deception attack, from victim interaction to cache poisoning?**
   - **In a Web Cache Deception attack, why is it critical that the victim accesses a resource that the cache has been instructed not to cache (e.g., a page with dynamic content)?**
   - **How does an attacker manipulate a web server's cache by altering the file extension or resource type? Provide a practical example.**
   - **Explain the role of cache headers in a Web Cache Deception attack. How do they influence cache behavior?**
   
### 2. **Attack Mechanisms & Exploitation:**
   - **Describe the attack mechanism when an attacker tricks the cache server into caching sensitive information (e.g., personal data or session information). How is this information later retrieved?**
   - **Explain how Cache Poisoning can be used to steal authentication tokens (e.g., JWT tokens) or other sensitive data via Web Cache Deception.**
   - **In the scenario where a logged-in user visits a manipulated URL, how does the attack exploit the server’s caching system to reveal private data?**
   - **What is the significance of adding a non-existent CSS file in a Web Cache Deception attack? Can you explain why this technique works?**

### 3. **Detection and Mitigation:**
   - **What steps would you take to detect Web Cache Deception vulnerabilities in a web application?**
   - **What is the "Cache Deception Armor" feature in Cloudflare, and how does it help prevent Web Cache Deception?**
   - **Can you outline how caching behaviors might differ between Cloudflare’s CDN and other proxy caches, and how this affects the potential for Web Cache Deception attacks?**
   - **How can developers prevent sensitive data from being cached? What are some best practices regarding cache-control headers?**
   - **Explain the potential role of security mechanisms like Content Security Policies (CSP) in mitigating Web Cache Deception attacks.**
   
### 4. **Advanced Exploitation Techniques:**
   - **How would you bypass Web Cache Deception Armor when using Cloudflare to prevent a cache server from caching harmful content?**
   - **What are some practical examples of using custom JavaScript or HTTP headers (e.g., `X-Forwarded-Host`) to poison the cache?**
   - **Can you describe how a Web Cache Deception attack could be escalated into an account takeover? Provide an example scenario.**
   - **What role does "un-keyed input" play in cache poisoning, and how would you identify such inputs in a vulnerable web application?**
   - **How can you exploit flaws in caching mechanisms for other attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE)?**

### 5. **Mitigation Strategies and Security Best Practices:**
   - **How would you configure caching headers (Cache-Control, Pragma, etc.) to ensure that dynamic and sensitive content is not cached?**
   - **Describe the potential impact of a malicious user exploiting a vulnerability in a website that does not set proper cache control for sensitive resources (e.g., session data, user profiles).**
   - **What are the key differences in how Cloudflare and traditional web servers handle caching of HTML content, and why is this important for preventing Web Cache Deception?**
   - **What should be the role of the developer when determining whether to cache a resource? How can you ensure that caching is applied only to static, non-sensitive resources?**
   
### 6. **Tools and Techniques for Identifying Web Cache Deception:**
   - **Explain the role of tools like PortSwigger's Param Miner in detecting Web Cache Poisoning and Deception vulnerabilities. How does it assist in discovering cache-related flaws?**
   - **What is the role of the “X-Forwarded-Host” header in Web Cache Deception, and how can an attacker use it to manipulate cache behavior?**
   - **Describe how you would use Burp Suite or similar tools to identify potential Web Cache Deception vulnerabilities during a penetration test.**

### 7. **Lab and Scenario-Based Questions:**
   - **Given a scenario where an attacker successfully poisons the cache by crafting a malicious `.css` path, what would be the first steps to reverse engineer the attack and identify the cache poisoning?**
   - **Imagine you are performing a web application penetration test and suspect that a page is being cached incorrectly. Walk through your methodology for confirming if the application is vulnerable to Web Cache Deception.**
   - **You are tasked with securing a web application that interacts with a third-party CDN like Cloudflare. What steps would you take to ensure that Web Cache Deception is not possible?**
   
### 8. **Vulnerability Examples and Case Studies:**
   - **Can you walk through the Web Cache Deception vulnerability discovered in PayPal, including the attack's methodology and the impact on the system?**
   - **Describe the OpenAI Web Cache Deception attack. How did attackers exploit a cached resource to steal authentication tokens (JWT)?**
   - **What security lessons can be learned from the Web Cache Deception attacks on services like PayPal and OpenAI? How did the vulnerabilities manifest, and what fixes were implemented?**

These questions aim to assess both theoretical knowledge and practical experience with Web Cache Deception vulnerabilities, their exploitation, detection, and mitigation. They cover various stages, from understanding the vulnerability to applying it in real-world scenarios and ensuring robust defenses.
