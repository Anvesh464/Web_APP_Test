### 1. **Understanding Zip Slip and its Mechanism**
   - **Question:** Can you explain in detail how the Zip Slip vulnerability works, and how does it allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system?
   - **What to look for:** A candidate should describe how Zip Slip exploits the extraction process of archives, particularly the use of directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) to write files outside the designated extraction directory, potentially overwriting critical files or placing malicious scripts in executable paths.

### 2. **Affected File Formats and Systems**
   - **Question:** Which archive file formats are most commonly vulnerable to the Zip Slip vulnerability, and why are these formats particularly susceptible?
   - **What to look for:** The candidate should mention various affected file formats such as ZIP, TAR, JAR, WAR, CPIO, APK, RAR, and 7z, explaining that these formats often allow symbolic links or absolute file paths that attackers can exploit to escape the extraction directory.

### 3. **Practical Example**
   - **Question:** Imagine youâ€™re tasked with securing an application that unpacks ZIP files. If a malicious ZIP file with the structure `../../../../etc/passwd` is extracted, what would be the consequence on a Linux system? How would you defend against this?
   - **What to look for:** Look for a detailed understanding of the specific consequences of writing to sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`. Candidates should mention system file corruption, privilege escalation, and unauthorized access risks. Defense mechanisms may include validating file paths, ensuring extractions only occur within designated directories, and rejecting absolute paths or symbolic links.

### 4. **Exploit Analysis and Tools**
   - **Question:** How would you use tools like `ptoomey3/evilarc` or `usdAG/slipit` to create a Zip Slip exploit? What do these tools automate, and what is the significance of the crafted malicious archive?
   - **What to look for:** Candidates should understand the role of tools like `evilarc` and `slipit` in automating the creation of malicious archives. They should explain how these tools exploit Zip Slip by generating archives with crafted filenames or directory traversal payloads.

### 5. **Defense Mechanisms and Secure Archive Extraction**
   - **Question:** How can you modify the extraction logic of an application to prevent Zip Slip vulnerabilities? What specific checks would you implement?
   - **What to look for:** Look for suggestions such as verifying file paths before extraction, rejecting filenames containing directory traversal sequences, normalizing file paths, using secure libraries for archive handling, and ensuring extractions occur within bounded directories. Candidates should also discuss the importance of avoiding symbolic link extraction.

### 6. **Security Best Practices for Archive Handling**
   - **Question:** What are the security best practices for handling user-uploaded archives to prevent attacks like Zip Slip? How would you ensure that extracted files are safe?
   - **What to look for:** The candidate should recommend practices like sanitizing file names, using file type verification (MIME type checks), restricting the extraction path, avoiding extraction of symlinks, and using updated, secure libraries for extracting archives.

### 7. **Impact Assessment and Remediation**
   - **Question:** How would you assess the impact of a Zip Slip vulnerability in an application? If you discovered this vulnerability in a production system, what steps would you take to remediate it quickly?
   - **What to look for:** The candidate should discuss how to identify affected systems, test for vulnerable code (possibly with automated security testing), patch the vulnerability, and deploy any necessary updates. Remediation may include applying patches to vulnerable libraries, conducting security reviews, and using secure extraction libraries.

### 8. **Exploring Real-World Examples**
   - **Question:** Can you provide any real-world examples where the Zip Slip vulnerability has been exploited, and how was the issue addressed in these cases?
   - **What to look for:** Candidates should provide references to actual CVEs or incidents where Zip Slip was exploited (e.g., a supply chain attack or a system compromise), and describe the response, such as updates to vulnerable libraries or patches deployed by vendors.

### 9. **Zip Slip in the Context of DevOps**
   - **Question:** How could Zip Slip be a potential risk in DevOps pipelines, particularly in software artifact distribution (e.g., JAR or APK files)? What security controls should be in place to mitigate these risks?
   - **What to look for:** Candidates should understand that Zip Slip can be exploited in the context of CI/CD pipelines if developers use archives in their deployment processes. Security controls might include scanning archives for directory traversal vulnerabilities, validating content before deployment, and ensuring that only trusted, vetted archives are deployed.

### 10. **File Integrity Checks and Validation**
   - **Question:** How would you ensure the integrity and safety of files extracted from user-provided archives in a secure manner?
   - **What to look for:** Candidates should discuss integrity checks such as cryptographic hash verification, validation of file paths and names, and the importance of implementing strict policies regarding which files can be extracted (e.g., rejecting files outside specific directories).

### 11. **Advanced Scanning and Detection**
   - **Question:** If you were building a security tool to detect Zip Slip vulnerabilities in an archive processing system, what type of techniques would you use to scan and detect malicious file paths?
   - **What to look for:** The candidate should mention techniques like scanning filenames for directory traversal sequences, checking for symlinks pointing to sensitive directories, and integrating with static analysis tools that examine archive extraction behavior for security flaws.

### 12. **Future-Proofing and Evolution of Exploits**
   - **Question:** Given the rise of various archive formats (e.g., 7z, TAR, and APK) in different environments, how do you anticipate new variations of the Zip Slip vulnerability might emerge, and what are the future challenges in securing archive extraction processes?
   - **What to look for:** Look for forward-thinking answers that acknowledge evolving attack strategies (e.g., bypassing new extraction restrictions, exploiting metadata or compression techniques), and how software developers and security teams can stay ahead by continually auditing extraction processes and using modern, secure libraries.
