Here are advanced interview questions related to **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)**, along with detailed answers:

---

### 1. **What is Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), and why is it a critical security vulnerability?**
   **Answer**:  
   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)** occur when an application exposes internal objects (e.g., database records, files, or URLs) to users, and these objects can be directly accessed or modified based on user-supplied input. This vulnerability arises when the application does not properly validate whether a user has the right to access or modify the specified object.  
   
   IDOR is critical because it allows attackers to bypass authorization controls, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, such as viewing, deleting, or modifying records that belong to other users. For example, if a user can change the `user_id` in the URL to access someone else's profile, this is an IDOR vulnerability.

### 2. **How would you test for IDOR vulnerabilities in a web application?**
   **Answer**:  
   To test for IDOR vulnerabilities:
   1. **Identify Object References**: Look for parameters like `user_id`, `order_id`, or `file_id` in URLs or API endpoints.
   2. **Modify Input Values**: Change these parameters to guess other valid object identifiers (e.g., increment/decrement numerical IDs or try common identifiers like email addresses).
   3. **Access Unauthorized Resources**: Attempt to access objects that should not be accessible by altering the object reference, such as modifying `user_id=123` to `user_id=124` in the URL.
   4. **Check for Unrestricted Access**: Verify if unauthorized users can access objects they shouldn't have permission to view or modify, which indicates the presence of IDOR.
   5. **Use Tools**: Tools like Burp Suite extensions (e.g., Authz, AuthMatrix) can help automate the discovery of authorization flaws, including IDOR vulnerabilities.

### 3. **Explain the impact of a successful IDOR attack.**
   **Answer**:  
   The impact of a successful IDOR attack can be severe, as it allows attackers to:
   1. **Unauthorized Data Access**: Access confidential information that they shouldn't be able to see, such as another user’s personal data, orders, messages, etc.
   2. **Data Manipulation or Deletion**: Modify or delete data that belongs to other users, potentially leading to data corruption or loss.
   3. **Privilege Escalation**: Attackers might gain higher levels of access (e.g., viewing admin data or performing admin-level actions).
   4. **Financial Fraud**: In cases like online banking or payment applications, attackers could view transaction data or make unauthorized transfers.
   5. **Legal Consequences**: Exposing sensitive customer information can lead to compliance issues (GDPR, HIPAA) and result in legal penalties or reputation damage.

### 4. **What types of parameters are commonly involved in IDOR vulnerabilities?**
   **Answer**:  
   IDOR vulnerabilities can arise from various types of parameters, including:
   - **Numeric Value Parameters**: These could be sequential numbers like `user_id=123`, `order_id=456`, or timestamps like Unix epoch time.
   - **Common Identifiers**: Identifiers like usernames, emails, or customer IDs (e.g., `username=john_doe` or `email=john.doe@mail.com`).
   - **Hashed Parameters**: In some cases, web applications use hashed values like `md5(username)` or `sha1(email)` for user identification. If these hashes are predictable or can be brute-forced, it leads to IDOR.
   - **UUID/GUID**: Some applications generate UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) based on timestamps or system details. Predictable UUIDs (e.g., MongoDB Object IDs) can lead to IDOR if attackers can guess future or past IDs.
   - **Wildcard Parameters**: Some systems might allow wildcard characters (e.g., `*`, `%`, `_`) in parameters to access multiple or all objects, potentially revealing data of all users.

---

### 5. **How can weak pseudo-random number generators (PRNG) contribute to IDOR vulnerabilities?**
   **Answer**:  
   Weak PRNGs generate predictable values that can be used to guess valid identifiers. For instance:
   - **UUID/GUID v1**: These identifiers are based on the timestamp when they were created, so if an attacker knows the current time or has access to previous UUIDs, they can predict future UUIDs.
   - **MongoDB Object IDs**: MongoDB’s Object IDs are partially based on time, making them predictable. If an attacker knows one valid ID, they can easily predict subsequent IDs by incrementing them or using the timestamp.
   
   If these values are used as object references (e.g., user IDs, session IDs), attackers can manipulate or guess these IDs to access unauthorized resources, resulting in an IDOR vulnerability.

---

### 6. **What are some effective methods to mitigate IDOR vulnerabilities in a web application?**
   **Answer**:  
   To mitigate IDOR vulnerabilities:
   1. **Enforce Proper Authorization Checks**: Always verify that the logged-in user has the appropriate permissions to access or modify the object they are requesting. This can include role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).
   2. **Use Indirect References**: Instead of using predictable, direct identifiers (like `user_id`), use indirect references (e.g., tokens or random UUIDs) that do not expose sensitive information.
   3. **Randomize Identifiers**: Use unpredictable, strong random values for identifiers instead of sequential numbers or timestamp-based values.
   4. **Check Access Control on Every Request**: Ensure that every request to access an object is properly authorized, even if the object reference is valid.
   5. **Limit Object Exposure**: Ensure that objects such as files, database records, or endpoints that contain sensitive data are not unnecessarily exposed via URLs or user inputs.
   6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect unauthorized access attempts or unusual patterns, such as users accessing data they shouldn't.

### 7. **Can you explain how parameter pollution can be used to exploit IDOR vulnerabilities?**
   **Answer**:  
   **Parameter pollution** is when an attacker sends multiple values for the same parameter to manipulate how the server processes them. In the context of IDOR:
   1. An attacker might use URL parameters like `user_id=attacker_id&user_id=victim_id`, hoping that the server processes both IDs, and allows the attacker to bypass checks or access the victim’s resources.
   2. The attacker can try different combinations of parameters, such as injecting multiple `user_id` or other object parameters to see if the server mishandles the request, allowing unauthorized access.

   Tools like Burp Suite can automate this process to test for such vulnerabilities by submitting multiple values for critical parameters.

### 8. **What is the difference between numeric value parameters and hashed parameters in the context of IDOR vulnerabilities?**
   **Answer**:  
   - **Numeric Value Parameters**: These are straightforward numeric identifiers (e.g., `user_id=123`). Attackers can often guess valid values by incrementing or decrementing the number, or by using known values (e.g., user IDs within a known range).
   
   - **Hashed Parameters**: These are parameters that are the result of a hash function, such as `md5(username)` or `sha1(email)`. Although hashes are supposed to be unique, attackers may be able to reverse engineer or guess values if the hash algorithm is weak (e.g., MD5 or SHA1) or if the hash is poorly implemented (e.g., no salt). If an attacker can find the original data (such as the email), they can generate the corresponding hash and gain unauthorized access to data.

---

### 9. **What is a wildcard parameter, and how can it be abused in IDOR attacks?**
   **Answer**:  
   A **wildcard parameter** allows an attacker to access multiple resources by using a special character (e.g., `*`, `%`, or `_`). For instance, an API request like:
   - `GET /api/users/*`
   - `GET /api/users/%`
   
   These can be used to return data for all users in a system instead of just a specific user, potentially revealing sensitive information across all user accounts. If the application backend does not properly validate the wildcard or if it returns data for all users when it shouldn't, this can lead to a severe data breach.

---

### 10. **How can you detect and exploit an IDOR vulnerability in a MongoDB-based application?**
   **Answer**:  
   - **Detection**: Since MongoDB generates predictable object IDs, an attacker can guess valid object IDs by incrementing or decrementing the value of the MongoDB Object ID (e.g., `5ae9b90a2c144b9def01ec37`). An attacker can attempt to manipulate the ID in the request to access other users’ data.
   - **Exploitation**: If a MongoDB Object ID is used to reference a user or an object, and no additional checks are performed to verify access permissions, an attacker can modify the object ID to gain unauthorized access to data. For example, changing the `user_id` parameter from `5ae9b90a2c144b9def01ec37` to `5ae9b90a2c144b9def01ec38` could potentially reveal the next user’s data.
