### 1. What is Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) and how does it differ from other injection attacks like SQL Injection and XSS?

**Answer**: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a vulnerability that occurs when user input is embedded within server-side templates without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary template code on the server, potentially leading to remote code execution. Unlike SQL Injection, which targets databases, and XSS, which targets client-side scripts, SSTI exploits template engines used to render dynamic content on the server.

### 2. Can you explain the methodology for identifying a vulnerable input field in an application susceptible to SSTI?

**Answer**: The methodology for identifying a vulnerable input field involves:
1. Locating an input field, URL parameter, or any user-controllable part of the application that is passed into a server-side template.
2. Injecting template syntax specific to common template engines (e.g., `{{7*7}}` for Jinja2) to see if the input is executed.
3. Observing the response for evidence of template execution, such as arithmetic results or syntax errors.

### 3. Describe the process of injecting template syntax to enumerate the template engine being used.

**Answer**: To enumerate the template engine:
1. Inject various template syntaxes into the identified vulnerable input field.
2. Use common expressions for different engines (e.g., `{{7*7}}` for Jinja2, `#{7*7}` for Thymeleaf).
3. Analyze the server's response to determine which syntax is being interpreted correctly.
4. Once the correct syntax is identified, confirm the template engine by testing more advanced features specific to that engine.

### 4. How would you escalate an SSTI vulnerability to achieve remote code execution on the server?

**Answer**: To escalate an SSTI vulnerability:
1. Identify the template engine being used.
2. Research or craft payloads that exploit the engine's features to execute arbitrary code.
3. For example, in Jinja2, you can use:
   ```python
   {{ self._TemplateReference__context.cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('id').read() }}
   ```
4. Inject the payload into the vulnerable input field.
5. Verify the command execution by checking the server's response for the output.

### 5. What are some common template engines and their respective syntax for SSTI attacks?

**Answer**:
- **Jinja2 (Python)**: `{{7*7}}`
- **Thymeleaf (Java)**: `#{7*7}`
- **Twig (PHP)**: `{{7*7}}`
- **FreeMarker (Java)**: `${7*7}`
- **Velocity (Java)**: `#set($x = 7 * 7)`

### 6. How can you bypass server-side filters to exploit SSTI vulnerabilities?

**Answer**: Bypassing server-side filters can be achieved by:
1. Using encoded payloads to evade detection.
2. Leveraging nested expressions or obfuscation techniques to bypass simple blacklists.
3. Identifying and exploiting any secondary vulnerabilities that allow bypassing filters (e.g., parameter pollution).
4. Using polyglot payloads that combine multiple syntaxes.

---

### 7. What are the potential impacts of a successful SSTI attack on an application and its users?

**Answer**: Potential impacts include:
1. Remote Code Execution (RCE): Gaining unauthorized access to execute commands on the server.
2. Data Leakage: Extracting sensitive information stored on the server.
3. Defacement: Modifying website content.
4. Denial of Service (DoS): Disrupting the normal operation of the server by executing resource-intensive commands.
5. Privilege Escalation: Leveraging the server's privileges to access other systems and data.

### 8. Can you provide an example of a polyglot payload that can be used to test for SSTI vulnerabilities?

**Answer**: A polyglot payload that works across multiple template engines:
