### 1. **Fundamentals of WebSockets:**
   - **What are WebSockets, and how do they differ from traditional HTTP communication?**
   - **Can you explain the WebSocket handshake process and how the client and server establish a connection?**
   - **What are the primary use cases of WebSockets in modern web applications? Why are they preferred for real-time, low-latency communication?**
   - **What are the main security concerns associated with WebSockets, and how do they differ from concerns in regular HTTP communication?**

### 2. **WebSocket Protocols and Security:**
   - **Explain the role of the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header in WebSocket communication. How would an attacker exploit an incorrectly handled `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` during a WebSocket connection?**
   - **How does WebSocket's use of cookies during the handshake introduce potential vulnerabilities, especially when CSRF protections are weak or absent?**
   - **What is Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH), and how can it be mitigated?**
   - **In a CSWSH attack, what happens if a WebSocket connection does not use proper token-based authentication or nonce verification? Can you describe how this can lead to a hijacking scenario?**

### 3. **WebSocket Attacks and Exploitation:**
   - **Describe how an attacker might use a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) attack to exfiltrate sensitive data from a vulnerable WebSocket connection.**
   - **In a CSWSH scenario, explain how an attacker can send a crafted WebSocket request from a malicious site and retrieve messages from a victimâ€™s authenticated session.**
   - **What strategies can you employ to prevent CSWSH attacks in a WebSocket-based application?**
   - **How can WebSocket message manipulation be used to exploit vulnerabilities in real-time applications (e.g., chat apps, financial platforms)?**
   - **What is the difference between a WebSocket message being intercepted and manipulated by an attacker vs. a complete WebSocket hijacking attack?**

### 4. **Tools and Techniques for WebSocket Penetration Testing:**
   - **What is `wsrepl`, and how does it simplify WebSocket penetration testing?**
   - **Describe the functionality of the `ws-harness.py` tool and how it can be used to manipulate WebSocket messages on the fly.**
   - **How does `wsrepl`'s plugin system work, and how would you automate a test that modifies WebSocket messages during a pentest?**
   - **How do you use `ws-harness.py` to perform fuzz testing on WebSocket messages? Can you provide an example of using a fuzzing payload in a WebSocket request?**
   - **Explain the process of performing WebSocket message injection with tools like `ws-harness.py` to test for SQL injection or other vulnerabilities in real-time WebSocket applications.**

### 5. **Security Best Practices for WebSockets:**
   - **What are the key security practices to follow when designing WebSocket-based applications to ensure they are resistant to common attacks like CSWSH and message injection?**
   - **How would you secure WebSocket connections to prevent eavesdropping or tampering with data in transit?**
   - **Describe the potential security impact of not validating incoming WebSocket messages, especially when they are used for user authentication or sensitive data exchange.**
   - **How can a WebSocket server be configured to enforce strict security policies, such as limiting connection origins or using strong encryption (e.g., TLS)?**
   - **What are the challenges in scaling WebSocket connections securely in high-traffic applications? How do you maintain a secure WebSocket connection at scale?**

### 6. **Mitigation Techniques for WebSocket Vulnerabilities:**
   - **What are the steps you would take to prevent WebSocket message manipulation during a penetration test, especially in a live chat application?**
   - **Explain how CSRF tokens or nonce values can be used to protect WebSocket handshakes. How would you implement this security measure in a WebSocket-based app?**
   - **Discuss how you would use `wss://` (WebSocket Secure) in conjunction with TLS to secure WebSocket communications. How does TLS mitigate certain WebSocket security risks?**
   - **How can you protect sensitive data transmitted over WebSockets from being exploited through message interception or hijacking?**
   - **What are some techniques for rate-limiting WebSocket connections to prevent abuse, such as denial-of-service attacks or brute-force attempts on WebSocket-based authentication?**

### 7. **Advanced Exploitation and Research:**
   - **How would you identify and exploit a vulnerability in a WebSocket handshake if you discover that the WebSocket connection is not properly authenticated?**
   - **Can you describe how WebSocket message injection can be used to exploit vulnerabilities such as command injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in real-time web apps?**
   - **In a scenario where an attacker controls a WebSocket server, what kind of attacks can they launch on clients connecting to the server, and how would you mitigate these risks?**
   - **Given a scenario where an attacker can send malicious WebSocket messages to a server, how would you identify and prevent message-based attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection)?**

### 8. **Hands-on Scenarios and Labs:**
   - **Imagine you're testing a WebSocket-based application where the authentication process is exposed to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking. Walk me through the steps you would take to exploit this vulnerability and exfiltrate sensitive data.**
   - **You have identified a WebSocket endpoint in an application that is vulnerable to message injection. How would you craft a payload to exploit this vulnerability, and what type of impact could this have on the application?**
   - **In a WebSocket application with poor CSRF protection, explain how you could hijack a valid session and interact with the WebSocket in a way that impacts other users.**
   - **How would you use `wsrepl` to automate testing for WebSocket message manipulation in a real-time web app? Provide a detailed walkthrough of creating a test script with plugins.**

### 9. **Case Studies and Vulnerability Reports:**
   - **Can you provide a real-world example where WebSocket vulnerabilities led to significant security breaches? What was the cause of the issue, and how could it have been prevented?**
   - **In a WebSocket-based attack scenario, what could be the potential consequences of an attacker manipulating WebSocket messages to inject harmful payloads?**
   - **How would you analyze a vulnerability in a WebSocket server where the authentication or authorization mechanisms are bypassed due to improper validation of handshake requests?**
