1. **What is DNS Rebinding, and how does it exploit the same-origin policy in web browsers?**
   - *Answer*: DNS Rebinding is an attack technique that allows a malicious website to bypass the same-origin policy in web browsers and interact with internal network resources. By manipulating DNS responses, an attacker can change the IP address of a domain name to the IP address of an internal network device after the initial connection is established. This allows the attacker's JavaScript to make unauthorized requests to the internal network, as the browser treats the malicious site and the internal site as being from the same origin.

2. **Describe the typical methodology of a DNS rebinding attack. What are the key steps involved?**
   - *Answer*: 
     - **Setup Phase**: Register a malicious domain (e.g., `malicious.com`) and configure a custom DNS server to resolve the domain to different IP addresses.
     - **Initial Victim Interaction**: Create a webpage on `malicious.com` with malicious JavaScript and entice the victim to visit the page.
     - **Initial DNS Resolution**: The browser queries the DNS server for `malicious.com` and receives a legitimate-looking IP address.
     - **Rebinding to Internal IP**: The DNS server updates the resolution for `malicious.com` to an internal IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1) after the initial request.
     - **Same-Origin Exploitation**: Malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser can now interact with internal network resources, bypassing same-origin policy.

3. **How can an attacker use DNS rebinding to bypass same-origin policy restrictions and access internal network resources?**
   - *Answer*: By changing the IP address of a domain after the initial connection is established, the attacker can trick the browser into treating requests to internal IP addresses as if they are from the same origin. This allows the attacker's JavaScript to send requests to and receive responses from internal network resources, effectively bypassing the same-origin policy.

4. **What are some common tools used for DNS rebinding attacks? Provide a brief overview of their functionalities.**
   - *Answer*:
     - **Singularity**: A DNS rebinding attack framework that allows attackers to set up and execute rebinding attacks.
     - **rebind.it**: A web client for the Singularity framework.
     - **rbndr**: A simple DNS rebinding service that facilitates the attack by resolving domains to different IP addresses.
     - **rebinder**: A tool that helps configure and execute DNS rebinding attacks using rbndr.

5. **Explain the purpose of using very short TTL (time-to-live) values in DNS rebinding attacks.**
   - *Answer*: Using very short TTL values forces the browser to frequently re-resolve the domain name, allowing the attacker to update the IP address resolution quickly. This enables the attacker to change the IP address from a legitimate-looking external address to an internal IP address shortly after the initial connection, facilitating the DNS rebinding attack.

6. **What are the potential consequences of a successful DNS rebinding attack on a victim's machine or network?**
   - *Answer*: 
     - Unauthorized access to internal network resources.
     - Execution of arbitrary commands on internal devices.
     - Exfiltration of sensitive information from internal systems.
     - Potential compromise of internal network security.

7. **Discuss the various protection bypass techniques (e.g., using 0.0.0.0, CNAME records) used in DNS rebinding attacks. How do these techniques help circumvent common security measures?**
   - *Answer*: 
     - **0.0.0.0**: Can be used to access localhost (127.0.0.1) by bypassing filters that block DNS responses containing 127.0.0.1.
     - **CNAME Records**: Bypass DNS protection solutions by returning a CNAME of an internal server, which is then resolved by the local DNS server, circumventing internal IP address filters.

8. **How can organizations defend against DNS rebinding attacks? What mitigation strategies can be implemented?**
   - *Answer*:
     - Implement DNS rebinding protections in browsers and network devices.
     - Block external DNS responses that resolve to internal IP addresses.
     - Use web application firewalls to monitor and block malicious requests.
     - Educate users about the risks of visiting untrusted websites.

9. **What role does null character injection play in DNS rebinding attacks? How does it help evade security filters?**
   - *Answer*: Null character injection can be used to truncate or manipulate strings in DNS queries or responses, bypassing security filters that rely on string matching or length limitations. This technique allows attackers to evade detection and execute the DNS rebinding attack.

10. **Can DNS rebinding attacks be detected and monitored? If so, what methods or tools would you use to detect such attacks?**
    - *Answer*: 
      - Monitor DNS query patterns and detect frequent re-resolutions of the same domain with varying IP addresses.
      - Use intrusion detection systems (IDS) to identify suspicious DNS activity.
      - Implement logging and analysis tools to track DNS queries and responses for anomalies.
