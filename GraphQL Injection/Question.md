### Advanced Interview Questions on GraphQL Injection

**1. What is GraphQL, and how does it differ from traditional REST APIs?**
   - GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with existing data. Unlike REST, where each request is tied to a specific endpoint, GraphQL allows clients to request only the data they need, potentially reducing over-fetching and under-fetching problems. It's more flexible because it lets clients specify the structure of the response.

**2. Can you explain what a GraphQL injection attack is and how it works?**
   - GraphQL injection occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate the structure of a GraphQL query to inject malicious queries or commands into the database. Similar to SQL injections, attackers exploit weaknesses in input validation or lack of authorization checks to perform unauthorized actions or retrieve sensitive data from a GraphQL endpoint.

**3. How can you identify an injection point in a GraphQL API?**
   - An injection point can be identified through introspection queries or error messages that indicate issues with query execution. You can send a query like `?query={__schema{types{name}}}` to retrieve the GraphQL schema. Errors or unexpected results may reveal injection points in the API.

**4. Explain the concept of schema introspection in GraphQL. How can it be exploited for injection attacks?**
   - Schema introspection allows clients to query the structure of the GraphQL API, including types, fields, and mutations. Attackers can use introspection to learn about the backend schema and craft malicious queries to exploit vulnerabilities. For example, by injecting queries that target specific fields, attackers could gain access to sensitive data.

**5. What are GraphQL mutations, and how can they be exploited in an attack?**
   - Mutations in GraphQL are used to modify server-side data, similar to HTTP POST or PUT requests in REST. Attackers can exploit mutations to perform unauthorized actions like modifying user data, creating new entries, or deleting records. Proper validation and authentication are necessary to protect mutations from abuse.

**6. How does GraphQL Batching work, and how can it be used for attacks like password brute-forcing or rate-limit bypass?**
   - GraphQL batching allows multiple queries to be sent in a single request, which improves performance by reducing the number of HTTP requests. However, this can be exploited for attacks such as brute-forcing passwords or bypassing rate limits by sending several mutation requests with different inputs in one batch, overwhelming the server.

**7. How would you protect a GraphQL endpoint from injection attacks?**
   - Protection mechanisms include:
     - Input validation: Ensure user inputs are properly sanitized to prevent malicious injections.
     - Authentication and Authorization: Implement strict access control to ensure users can only query or mutate the data they are authorized to access.
     - Disable introspection in production environments to prevent attackers from learning the schema.
     - Query complexity analysis to limit excessively large or deeply nested queries.
     - Using a security library like `graphql-shield` to enforce permissions.

**8. Can you explain how NoSQL and SQL injections can occur in a GraphQL API?**
   - **NoSQL Injection:** Attackers can manipulate JSON objects or use operators like `$regex` or `$ne` in search parameters, targeting NoSQL databases like MongoDB through GraphQL queries.
     - Example: `{ doctors(options: "{\"patients.ssn\" :1}", search: "{ \"patients.ssn\": { \"$regex\": \".*\"}, \"lastName\":\"Admin\" }") { firstName lastName id patients{ssn} } }`
   
   - **SQL Injection:** Similar to traditional SQL injections, attackers can inject SQL commands by inserting special characters like single quotes (`'`) into GraphQL queries.
     - Example: `{ bacon(id: "1'") { id, type, price } }`

**9. What is the role of introspection in GraphQL security testing?**
   - Introspection allows security professionals to map out a GraphQL APIâ€™s structure and identify potential vulnerabilities by discovering the types, fields, and possible queries. Attackers can use this information to craft malicious queries or target sensitive data. Disabling introspection in production environments is a common security best practice.

**10. How can tools like GraphQLMap, InQL, and GQLSpection be used to test the security of a GraphQL API?**
   - **GraphQLMap:** A scripting engine used for automating the enumeration and exploitation of GraphQL endpoints, assisting in detecting vulnerabilities like injection points.
   - **InQL:** A Burp Suite extension designed for testing the security of GraphQL APIs, including finding injection points and checking for weaknesses.
   - **GQLSpection:** A tool that parses GraphQL introspection schemas to generate potential queries, helping security researchers identify attack vectors and sensitive fields.

**11. Describe the process of extracting sensitive data from a GraphQL endpoint using projections and pagination techniques.**
   - **Projections:** Projections involve crafting GraphQL queries to fetch only specific data fields of interest, often using nested fields to drill down into sensitive information. For example, using `{doctors(options: "{\"patients.ssn\" :1}"){firstName lastName id patients{ssn}}}`.
   - **Pagination (Edges/Nodes):** GraphQL APIs often use pagination (with fields like `edges`, `nodes`, `pageInfo`) to manage large data sets. Attackers can use these to extract large volumes of data by navigating through paginated results.

**12. Can you explain the importance of GraphQL security audits and how tools like graphql-cop are useful?**
   - Security audits help identify and mitigate potential risks in GraphQL APIs, such as improper input validation, insecure authentication, or overexposed sensitive data. Tools like `graphql-cop` automate the process of auditing GraphQL endpoints, scanning for misconfigurations, and generating reports on possible security gaps.

**13. How would you approach performing a GraphQL security test on a public API?**
   - **Step 1:** Identify the GraphQL endpoint (commonly `/graphql` or `/graphiql`).
   - **Step 2:** Check if introspection is enabled. If introspection is allowed, dump the schema to understand the available types and fields.
   - **Step 3:** Test for injection points by sending malicious queries (e.g., SQL or NoSQL injection).
   - **Step 4:** Test for authorization flaws by attempting to access sensitive data without proper credentials or permissions.
   - **Step 5:** Look for other vulnerabilities like excessive query complexity or rate-limiting issues.

**14. How does the concept of 'suggestions' work in GraphQL security, and how can attackers leverage it for exploitation?**
   - When a user tries to query a non-existent field in GraphQL, the backend may return a suggestion, like "Did you mean 'node'?" Attackers can exploit these suggestions to brute-force valid field and type names, helping them identify valid attack vectors.

**15. What are the best practices for securing a GraphQL API in production?**
   - Disable introspection in production.
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force and denial-of-service attacks.
   - Secure the GraphQL server with proper authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT).
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injections.
   - Apply authorization controls using GraphQL-specific permission libraries.

These questions test a candidate's knowledge of GraphQL security, injection attacks, best practices, and security testing tools.
