### **1. GraphQL Injection and Security**
- **What are the key differences between SQL Injection and GraphQL Injection, and how can GraphQL be exploited differently than traditional REST APIs?**
- **Explain how an attacker might exploit a vulnerable GraphQL schema via introspection. What precautions should developers take to protect against this?**
- **How would you prevent a GraphQL API from being abused through recursive queries or deep nesting, which could lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks?**
- **In the context of GraphQL, how would you detect and mitigate potential **NoSQL** injections, especially when dealing with MongoDB-like databases?**
- **How can you exploit GraphQL's flexible query structure to bypass authorization checks and access unauthorized data?**
- **Can you explain the concept of 'query complexity' in GraphQL and how it can be used to protect APIs from malicious queries?**

### **2. Advanced Enumeration and Testing Techniques**
- **Describe the process of identifying and enumerating a GraphQL endpoint in a black-box testing scenario. What techniques or tools would you use to discover hidden or non-documented queries and mutations?**
- **Explain how the GraphQL Introspection Query works, and how attackers can use it to discover the full schema of a GraphQL server. What mitigations would you suggest?**
- **How would you go about identifying **hidden** fields or types in a GraphQL schema when introspection is disabled? What tools or techniques would be most effective in this case?**
- **Describe the methodology to perform **fuzzing** of GraphQL queries. How would you design a fuzzing test to uncover vulnerabilities like improper input validation or unexpected data manipulations?**

### **3. Authentication & Authorization in GraphQL**
- **What are the security concerns around authentication and authorization in GraphQL APIs? How does the "resolver" pattern in GraphQL impact security?**
- **Explain how you would implement **role-based access control** (RBAC) in a GraphQL service. How would you ensure that authorization logic is securely integrated?**
- **How would you handle **multi-step authentication workflows** (e.g., 2FA) within a GraphQL API? What challenges might arise in this context?**
- **GraphQL has a strong focus on the granularity of data access. How can attackers bypass this granularity (e.g., by accessing sensitive data fields that they should not be able to view)?**

### **4. GraphQL Mutations and Input Validation**
- **How would you mitigate the risk of **mutation abuse** in GraphQL, where an attacker may attempt to exploit endpoints to modify data maliciously?**
- **Describe the potential vulnerabilities in a GraphQL mutation endpoint. How can you ensure that mutations (e.g., creating, updating, deleting) are safe from injection and manipulation attacks?**
- **In the context of GraphQL, what techniques would you employ to prevent **mass assignment** vulnerabilities, where users can send unauthorized fields during mutation requests?**

### **5. GraphQL Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection**
- **What is query batching in GraphQL, and how can it be abused to cause a **Denial of Service** attack? How would you prevent query batching abuse?**
- **GraphQL queries allow nested queries, which can lead to excessive resource consumption. How would you implement **rate-limiting** or **query depth-limiting** to avoid performance degradation or potential DDoS attacks?**
- **What is query complexity analysis, and how does it help mitigate abusive GraphQL queries? Explain how to calculate query complexity and set appropriate limits.**

### **6. Advanced Security Best Practices**
- **What are the most effective ways to secure a GraphQL endpoint against data leaks from misconfigurations, such as accidental exposure of sensitive fields or types?**
- **How would you secure a GraphQL API deployed in a **microservices architecture** where each service may have different security and access controls?**
- **What steps would you take to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks in GraphQL APIs?**
- **Explain the importance of **input validation** and **sanitization** in GraphQL and why it's critical even if GraphQL APIs are type-safe.**

### **7. Real-World Exploit Scenarios**
- **Provide a real-world scenario in which a GraphQL API could be exploited to escalate privileges. How would you detect and prevent such an attack?**
- **Explain how you would exploit an **insecure GraphQL API** by chaining queries and mutations to escalate access, extract sensitive data, or perform unauthorized actions.**
- **What are some **best practices** for **securing GraphQL endpoints** when dealing with multiple user roles and ensuring that the server only returns appropriate data based on user privileges?**

### **8. GraphQL API Design and Vulnerability Mitigation**
- **In a situation where you need to design a GraphQL API for handling financial transactions, what security considerations would you prioritize to prevent common attack vectors?**
- **What are the trade-offs between using GraphQL and traditional REST APIs in terms of security, especially in complex or highly sensitive applications?**
- **How do you handle **pagination** and **filtering** in GraphQL to avoid abuse? Describe potential security concerns and solutions for preventing unwanted data leakage.**

### **Bonus Questions (for Experts):**
- **How would you design a GraphQL API that requires both complex authorization (role-based and attribute-based access control) and strict data validation across multiple services?**
- **What is your understanding of **GraphQL federation**, and what are the potential security risks when using federated services in a large-scale GraphQL implementation?**
- **Discuss the impact of **GraphQL subscriptions** on security and performance. How do you ensure that subscription-based APIs are protected from misuse or DDoS attacks?**
- **Describe the role of **schema stitching** in GraphQL and the associated risks that come with stitching schemas from different services. How can security be maintained in such scenarios?**
